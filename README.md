Welcome to the intergalactic_trade_network1 
1. Design Decisions and Architectural Choices
Overview
The Intergalactic Trade Network is a backend system designed to handle trade transactions, manage space cargo, and track space station inventory across multiple planets and space stations. The system is built to handle high-throughput data and provide real-time updates on trade activities and cargo statuses. The architecture is built with scalability and performance in mind.

Architectural Choices
Backend Framework: Node.js & Express
Reason: Node.js provides an asynchronous, event-driven environment, making it ideal for handling high-throughput and real-time data interactions. Express is lightweight and allows for flexible routing and middleware integration.
Alternatives: Django (Python) or Spring Boot (Java) were considered but rejected for higher development complexity and less emphasis on real-time events.
Database: MongoDB
Reason: MongoDB’s document-based structure is ideal for dynamic and flexible data such as cargo items, trade transactions, and space station inventories. MongoDB's scalability and high throughput also make it suitable for handling large amounts of data across space stations.
Alternatives: SQL databases like PostgreSQL could offer better transaction consistency but were rejected due to their less flexible schema and scaling challenges with real-time applications.

2. Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Node.js: Version 14.x or higher
MongoDB: Locally or through a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas
NPM: Installed with Node.js
Git: For source code version control
Local Development Setup
Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone github_repo_link
cd intergalactic-trade-network
Step 2: Install Dependencies
npm install
Step 3: Set Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:

PORT=$PORT_NO
MONGODB_URI=YOUR_DATABASE_URI

Step 4: Run the Server
node server.js

3. Instructions for Testing API via Postman
Testing API Endpoints
Using Postman or curl
Get Trade by Transaction ID:

Sample test case:
 GET http://localhost:5000/api/trade/:id



Get Cargo by Shipment ID:

GET http://localhost:5000/api/cargo/:shipment_id
Get Inventory by Space Station ID:

GET http://localhost:5000/api/inventory/earth_station


POST request to add cargo,inventory entries:

POST http://localhost:5000/api/cargo
POST http://localhost:5000/api/inventory

4. Known Limitations and Potential Improvements
Known Limitations
Lack of Authentication: Currently, the system does not implement any authentication or authorization, which may be necessary to secure sensitive trade and cargo information.

Monolithic Architecture: While the current monolithic architecture is simple to implement, it may not scale well for larger intergalactic networks with many space stations and trades.

Potential Improvements
Microservices Architecture: As the network grows, transitioning to a microservices architecture would allow for independent scaling of the trade, cargo, and inventory services.

GraphQL: Moving from REST to GraphQL could enable more efficient querying for trade and inventory data, especially when clients need only specific fields from large datasets.

Authentication & Authorization: Implementing JWT or OAuth2 could add security layers to ensure only authorized users can make updates or query sensitive data.

Caching Layer: Adding a caching layer (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data (such as space station inventory) would improve performance.

Monitoring and Alerts: Incorporating logging, monitoring (e.g., Prometheus), and alerting systems would enhance the system’s observability and reliability.

Auto-scaling and Load Balancing: For larger deployments, adding auto-scaling and load balancing mechanisms will help handle an increase in load as trade traffic grows.
